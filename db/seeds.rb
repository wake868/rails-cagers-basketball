A players goal should not be to become the next Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant or Lebron James, it should be to become the best individual and team player that you can become, within the limits of your physical abilities. However to reach this goal you may have to spend an equal amount of time and effort as any of the aforementioned pros did when they were growing up, and learning the game.</p><p>This basketball program is definitely here to serve the kids.
